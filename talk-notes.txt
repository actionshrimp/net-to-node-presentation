Experience report wish-list:
- From https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6032-more-open-source-systems-please

1. Context
2. Limitations in "organisation"
3. Values in the group
4. Alternatives
5. High level view
6. Interesting details

Context
- 7digital.com - old website + history
- Responsive design (old website postage stamp)
- App sitting on top of API
- Use API fully - no DB / legacy deps

Limitations
- Wanted to release new design in one go for HD launch
- Livesearch as an initial attempt at gradually releasing stuff
- Design process bottleneck - multiple iterations of each page

Values in the group
- FP(?)
- Frustrated with windows ecosystem
- Enjoyed node from client side build tools, all pretty good at it
- Simplicity of single language across FE+BE

Alternatives
- Patching the existing webstore with the new design
- structure of existing app
- Handlebars - client side, tests

High level view of component (systems level)
- Middlewares
- Sections
- API client / calls
- Redis
- Caches

Interesting details
- Windows specific stuff
- Web.config switching, beta cookie
- Basket prototype
- Going live IIS rewrite problems
- Sharing state between applications, again going live / sentinel work. 
- fig.yml for infrastructure (being renamed to docker compose)
- Domains / error handling - event loop
- Don't use `this` anywhere
- Hilarious feedback

Do like
- Simplicity

Don't like
- Refactoring!

Going forwards
- Immutable.js
- React.js (isomorphic?)
- Much more automation of systems

Do differently?
- Break out of .NET container app much earlier!




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Beta cookie
- IISNode - web.config
- prototype growing out of control
- processCount
- debugging pretty tricky
- web.config to handle 1 endpoint at a time
- Sharing state with cookies while migrating
- sharing views (NUSTACHE!)
- basket endpoint load testing with old code
- Fig + docker for redis + sentinel
- IIS rewrite caching on release: fixed... iisnode upgrade, querystring thing

- Next steps:
    - React
    - Linux
    - AWS
